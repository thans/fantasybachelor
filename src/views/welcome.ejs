                <h3>Roses + Multipliers</h3>
                <p>Whenever any of your selected contestants accepts a rose, you will earn 1 point multiplied by the multiplier you have on the contestant. Each consecutive week you have a contestant anywhere in your lineup, the multiplier will increase by 1 up to a maximum multiplier of 3. For example, the first week a rose will be worth 1 point, 2 points the next week, but will never exceed 3 points. If you drop a contestant one week and pick them up again later, the multiplier will start back at 1 again.</p>

It does not matter who initiates the kiss, but subsequent kisses are only counted after both parties say at least one word each.</p>
